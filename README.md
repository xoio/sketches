# xoio.github.io
This repo serves as a way to host sketches for viewing, primarily on Codepen. 
I do a lot of ES6 so as you might imagine, at the moment, things need to be compiled, polyfilled and what have you. 
The resulting source code is often too large for Codepen to handle, as well as being too difficult to study so 
with that in mind, 


* all of the built code will reside here for display. 
* all of the source code will reside [on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/sortofsleepy/sketches)
* the reasoon everything isn't just on gitlab is because at the moment, they don't appear to support gzipping or https for their pages.
